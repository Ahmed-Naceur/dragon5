\subsection{Data structures}\label{sect:dat}

\vskip 0.2cm
The transfer of information between the modules is performed by means of well
defined data structures, also called objects. The objects can be defined in either
create, read-only or modification mode. Each object has its own specific signature
that can be easily recognized by a module. A detailed description of DONJON
data structures is given in \Sect{structure}. For more details on DRAGON and
TRIVAC data structures, refer to their guide\cite{dragstruc}.
A brief description of all data structures that can be used in DONJON is given
below. \\

\begin{ListeDeDescription}{mmmmmmmm}

\item[\dds{geometry}] data structure containing the geometry information.
This object has a signature {\tt L\_GEOM}; it is created using DRAGON
module \moc{GEO:}.

\item[\dds{macrolib}] data structure containing the multigroup macroscopic
properties; it has a signature {\tt L\_MACROLIB}. This object can be
created in several modules, namely: using DRAGON modules \moc{MAC:}
and \moc{NCR:}; or using DONJON modules \moc{CRE:}, \moc{MACINI:},
and \moc{NEWMAC:}.

\item[\dds{compo}] data structure containing the mono-parameter
database, generated by the lattice code.
This object has a signature {\tt L\_COMPO}; it is created using DRAGON
module \moc{CPO:}.

\item[\dds{multicompo}] data structure containing the multi-parameter
database, generated by the lattice code.
This object has a signature {\tt L\_MULTICOMPO}; it is created using
DRAGON module \moc{COMPO:}.

\item[\dds{saphyb}] data structure containing the multi-parameter
database, generated by the lattice code.
This object has a signature {\tt L\_SAPHYB}; it is created using
the APOLLO2 lattice code or the DRAGON module \moc{SAP:}.

\item[\dds{fmap}] data structure containing the fuel-lattice
specification. This object has a signature {\tt L\_MAP}; it is created
using DONJON module \moc{RESINI:}.

\item[\dds{matex}] data structure containing the extended reactor
material index. This object has a signature {\tt L\_MATEX}; it is created
using DONJON module \moc{USPLIT:}.

\item[\dds{device}] data structure containing the devices specification.
This object has a signature {\tt L\_DEVICE}; it is created using DONJON
module \moc{DEVINI:}.

\item[\dds{detect}] data structure containing detector positions and responses.
This object has a signature {\tt L\_DETECT}; it is created using DONJON
module \moc{DETINI:}, and can be modified by the modules
\moc{DETINI:} and \moc{DETECT:} .

\item[\dds{track}] data structure containing a "tracking" information
of the reactor geometry. This object has a signature {\tt L\_TRACK};
it is created using TRIVAC module \moc{TRIVAT:}.

\item[\dds{system}] data structure containing a set of system matrices.
This object has a signature {\tt L\_SYSTEM}; it is created using
TRIVAC module \moc{TRIVAA:}.

\item[\dds{flux}] data structure containing the numerical solution to
an eigenvalue problem. This object has a signature {\tt L\_FLUX};
it is created using TRIVAC module \moc{FLUD:}.

\item[\dds{power}] data structure containing the powers and normalized
fluxes over the reactor core. This object has a signature {\tt L\_POWER};
it is created using DONJON module \moc{FLPOW:}.

\item[\dds{history}] This data structure contains the information required to ensure a smooth coupling of
DRAGON with DONJON when an history based full reactor calculation is to be performed. It is used only by the
\moc{HST:} module.
