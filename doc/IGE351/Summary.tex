SUMMARY

\end{center}

This technical report contains the logical contents of the data structures used by the reactor physics codes DRAGON and TRIVAC Version5. These data structures are basically memory-resident associative tables that may contain inner structures made of associative tables and/or heterogeneous lists. These data structures are implemented using the LCM/XSM Application Programming Interface (API) described in the technical report IGE-232.
