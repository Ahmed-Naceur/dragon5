\subsection{APOLLO-1 microscopic cross-section examples}\label{sect:ExAPOLLO}

The test cases we will consider here use the \moc{LIB:} module to enter
microscopic cross sections taken from an APOLLO-1 99 groups microscopic
cross-sections library. We will assume that this library is located in file
\moc{APOLLIB}. The test cases are numbered successively from
\tst(TCA01) to \tst(TCA04).

\subsubsection{\tst(TCA01) -- The Mosteller benchmark.} 

  This benchmark is similar to the \tst(TCWW01) test case but uses the APOLLO-1 library. 

\listing{TCA01.c2m}

\subsubsection{\tst(TCA02) -- $17\times 17$ PWR type assembly}

This test case represents a production calculation of a normal PWR assembly with
cell grouping (\moc{MERGE} and \moc{TURN} options). Its configuration is
identical to the \tst(TCWW02) test case but uses the APOLLO-1 library.

\listing{TCA02.c2m}

\subsubsection{\tst(TCA03) -- an hexagonal assembly}

This test case represents a production calculation of a typical hexagonal
control assembly.  This problem is identical to the \tst(TCWW03) test case but
uses the APOLLO-1 library.

\listing{TCA03.c2m}

\subsubsection{\tst(TCA04) -- Cylindrical cell with isotopic depletion.}

This test case represents a a depletion calculation for the mosteller annular geometry.
The isotopic depletion chain for the heavy isotopes is the following is given
in \Fig{TCA04}.
