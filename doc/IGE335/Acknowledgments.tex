\section*{Acknowledgments}

The computer code DRAGON results from a concerted effort made at \'{E}cole Polytechnique de
Montr\'{e}al. The main authors of this  report would therefore like to express their thanks to
\'{E}cole Polytechnique de Montr\'{e}al for its support along the years as well as to
the graduate students and research associates which have contributed to the development of
DRAGON along the years. We would also like to thank Kevin E. Kohler at the Nova Southeastern University
Oceanographic Center  for letting us use and distribute a PostScript utility module derived from his
PSPLOT package. Finally, the DRAGON  team would never have survived without  the financial
support of the  Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),
Hydro--Qu\'{e}bec,  Atomic Energy of Canada limited (AECL) and the CANDU Owners Group (COG).
