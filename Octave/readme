 ASCII-Ganlibv4 
----------------


Purpose:
--------
A set of procedures has been developed to facilitate analysis from 
DRAGON and DONJON results. They provide tools to access rapidly and 
efficiently the content of data structures saved in ASCII format. 


Content:
--------
The set of procedures consists of: 
ASCIIGetv4.m  : Get data in a structure.
ASCIILibv4.m  : Display the structure name records and levels.
ASCIIOpnv4.m  : Open and read a structure. Record names and levels are stored 
                in several variables for further access.
ASCIILenv4.m  : Get the length of a record.
ASCIISixv4.m  : Move from one level to the other in the data structure.
                (0 go to the root
                 1 up to a child level
                 2 down to the parent level)


Description:
------------
It is mandatory to use these procedures to have OCTAVE (or MATLAB) already installed.

The content of data structures is documented in user guides: 
  - IGE295: DRAGON and TRIVAC (v4 and earlier)
  - IGE344: DONJON (v5)
  - IGE300: DONJON (v4)


Important notes:
For all users, the use of these procedures is illustrated in the example 
"data/TemplateVerifv4.m". It is highly recommended to run this file and 
have look at the results together with the file "fmap" used in this case.  

For those familiar with the use of LCM subroutines, this set of files 
follows the same ideas. For those who are not, a quick review of the 
GANLIB user guide could help to understand the point of each pocedure.


Examples in 'data' folder:
--------------------------
- TemplateVerifv4.m   : 
       Template used for verification and learning
- iaea3d.m            : 
       Plot the interpolated flux computed by the Trivac/data/iaea3d.x2m
